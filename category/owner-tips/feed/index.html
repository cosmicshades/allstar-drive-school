				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEW LAWS:</span> Beginning July 1, 2015, students who have completed the requirements for driver education, may get their license at 16 years and 90 days. Formally the law was 16 years and 180 days.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Older Laws:</span></p>
<p>As of March 25, 2012 the following new driver laws went into effect for the state of Indiana:</p>
<ul>
<li>A student must be 16 and 180 days before getting their license.</li>
<li>A student may take their drive test anytime after completing driver education, however they cannot get a license until they are 16 years, 180 days old.</li>
<li>Any new driver no matter what age, must hold their permit 180 days before getting their license.</li>
<li>New drivers under 18 cannot have a passenger in the car unless it is a sibling or someone in the front seat is above the age of 25. This applies only to the first 180 days of driving with a license.</li>
<li>A documented 50 supervised driving hour log must be submitted at time of getting a new license. Of those 50 hours, 10 must be night time driving. (You can find the supervised driving log <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.in.gov%2FDownload.aspx%3Fid%3D9758&amp;ei=9p31UavxAoiqyQGax4GYDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGUEt97l2uc8Pkyyd1J-61uNyTCjg&amp;sig2=O5gyvByHNf-uolZh8s4FYg&amp;bvm=bv.49784469,d.aWc">here</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once driver’s ed is completed they need to take a formal driving test. You can choose to take it at All Star, or the BMV.</p>
<p>If they are taking with us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call 2 weeks ahead of the date you want to take the test. You will set up a time for practice review and test. (All-in-one)</li>
<li>Bring paper permit and $30 for the test. Call us if there is a lost permit, as we can help you sort this out.</li>
<li>The test takes about 45 minutes to an hour, and will be administered by a drive instructor of the student&#8217;s choosing to make them feel at ease.</li>
</ul>
<p>If they are taking at the BMV they need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call and setup a time for the test (You will have to call to see when they have an opening.)</li>
<li>No cost $0</li>
<li>Have paper permit signed by us with both drive grade and classroom grade on it. (Look on back and there should be the words, Pass, Pass.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we can be of any assistance to you, please don’t hesitate to call. Remember it is vital that your child continue to drive as much as possible and fill out their driving log. The BMV will not issue a license without the log, so make sure you take the time to fill it out as you go!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow Down! Remember how slippery it is walking to a car in the snow or ice? You are only walking at 1-2 miles per hour and it is slick. Think what it will be for tires on the road. Only about the length of a boot of a tire touches the road. This doesn&#8217;t allow for much contact with pavement, making it difficult to stop. Slowing down even just 5 miles per hour will double your traction.</li>
<li>Better vision : Keep the windshield clean. Buy a jug of windshield washer fluid for under 3.00 and fill the windshield washer tank (under the hood) regularly. Stick the remainder in the trunk for the next time it needs filled up. Doing it yourself saves you time and money, and you know that it has been done an you are ready to drive.</li>
<li>Replace wiper blades 1 time a year to ensure that they work properly and do their job. Make sure the wiper blades fit snug against the windshield but don&#8217;t squeak on the windshield. If they squeak, the rubber wears down and they don&#8217;t last as long. Replacement is simple, and something you can do yourself. Most car manuals have instructions how to replace the blades, and blades are fairly inexpensive to replace.</li>
<li>Clean your headlights/tail lights! The gas stations have squeegees and paper towels that you can use to wipe off your lights and your windshield.</li>
<li>You should keep your lights on in all weather, and when you turn on your wipers, turn on your lights.</li>
<li>Your mother&#8217;s rules for crossing the street still apply! Look both ways when going through an intersection. Cars don&#8217;t always stop, and you should be a defensive driver to prevent an accident.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tips for Parents</h2>
<p>Hello Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>First let me thank you for choosing All Star Driving School. We will be doing our best to teach your child to be a safe and responsible driver.</p>
<p>The students will be signing up for driving sessions that accommodate their personal schedules. If something comes up and they need to change or miss a day, we can be flexible. We just ask that you let us know as soon as possible as we have arranged a driver for them. We have 9 drivers and we rotate them among the students so your child will not always have the same driver. We get the classwork in during the scheduled class time but not always the driving. If we still have driving to do that is usually done right after school the following week. If your child misses a class, there are ways we can make that up for them.</p>
<p>When driving with your teen, we strongly recommend you use commentary driving. This is a technique we use the first 3 drives. We will be talking to them the entire time, ex. cover the brake, start slowing down, and what do you see coming up? The last drives we do with them, we reverse and they talk to us. Driving is a habit so it is important that we get them in the right habits to begin with. They do need to practice with you. Please start your practices in empty parking lots, IU stadium area, church lots, or even school lots.</p>
<h4>Their rules:</h4>
<ol>
<li>A new driver can drive only with parent or guardian.</li>
<li>They may drive with ANYBODY in car as long as parent/guardian is in front seat.</li>
<li>They may drive in any city/state as long as parent/guardian is in front seat.</li>
<li>After driver’s ed, they can drive with any adult in the front seat who is 25 or older.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any concerns or questions, please don’t hesitate to ask us. Again, thanks for entrusting us with your special cargo.</p>
